que: Geek created a random series and given a name geek-onacci series. 
     Given four integers A, B, C, N. A, B, C represents the first three numbers of geek-onacci series.
     Find the Nth number of the series. The nth number of geek-onacci series is a sum of the last three numbers 
     (summation of N-1th, N-2th, and N-3th geek-onacci numbers)


#code
def geek(a, b, c, n):
   if n == 4:
       return a + b + c
   
   return geek(b, c, a + b + c, n - 1)

   
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
   a, b, c, n = map(int, input().split())
   nx = geek(a, b, c, n)
   print(nx)
