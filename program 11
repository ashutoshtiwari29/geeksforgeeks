que: You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes. 
     The task is to delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given. 
Note: No head reference is given to you. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the linked list.



class Solution:
    #Function to delete a node without any reference to head pointer.
    def deleteNode(self,curr_node):
        curr_node.data = curr_node.next.data
        curr_node.next = curr_node.next.next
